## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Here i learned about mobile-first workflow, where i design the page for mobile, and after mobile complited i start thingking on desktop layout. Its quite challenging for me because the mobile vesion and desktop version is so difference but still simple.

I learned how to make custome component where i create one component (like item of summary) and make it have difference color. I try to search for the right way to do that but i not sure with my keyword, and i not realy undertand what i reading, so i work with my own way. I try to follow what i doing when i used bootstrap, like when i used bootstrap button, i just put another class to select the color i want.

### Continued development

I not sure if my markup and css (scss) to complicated or could be more complicated. The component look simple at firsh glance.
Anyway, there is something i still feel not right is:
- In mobile version, summary section should have max width so is not to wide. Here i only use one breakpoint at 960px
- In desktop version, all component should be placed more center, verticaly and horizontaly. it already center on horizontal, but not in vertical. at least not in smaller screen size
- maybe i should put all list item inside ul tag not inside div.
